DALI commands
=============
In accordance with the DIN EN 60929 standard, addresses and commands are transmitted as numbers with a length of two bytes.

These commands take the form YAAA AAAS xxXXxx. Each letter here stands for one bit.

Y: type of address
     0bin:    short address
     1bin:    group address or collective call

A: significant address bit

S: selection bit (specifies the significance of the following eight bits):
     0bin:    the 8 xxXXxx bits contain a value for direct control of the lamp power
     1bin:    the 8 xxXXxx bits contain a command number.

x: a bit in the lamp power or in the command number


Type of Addresses
=================
Type of Addresses Byte Description
Short address 0AAAAAAS (AAAAAA = 0 to 63, S = 0/1)
Group address 100AAAAS (AAAA = 0 to 15, S = 0/1)
Broadcast address 1111111S (S = 0/1)
Special command 101CCCC1 (CCCC = command number)


Direct DALI commands for lamp power
===================================
These commands take the form YAAA AAA0 xxXXxx.

xxXXxx: the value representing the lamp power is transmitted in these 8 bits. It is calculated according to this formula: 

Pvalue = 10 ^ ((value-1) / (253/3)) * Pmax / 1000

253 values from 1dec to 254dec are available for transmission in accordance with this formula.

There are also 2 direct DALI commands with special meanings:

Command; Command No; Description; Answer
00hex; 0dec; The DALI device dims using the current fade time down to the parameterised MIN value, and then switches off.; - 
FFhex; 254dec; Mask (no change): this value is ignored in what follows, and is therefore not loaded into memory.; - 


Indirect DALI commands for lamp power
=====================================
These commands take the form YAAA AAA1 xxXXxx.

xxXXxx: These 8 bits transfer the command number. The available command numbers are listed and explained in the following tables in hexadecimal and decimal formats.

============================
According to IEC 60929, a DALI Master has to repeat several commands within 100 ms, so that DALI-Slaves will execute them. 

The DALI Master Terminal KL6811 repeats the commands 32dez to 128dez, 258dez and 259dez (bold marked) automatically to make the the double call from the user program unnecessary.

The DALI Master Terminal KL6811 repeats also the commands 224dez to 255dez, if you have activated this with Bit 1 of the Control-Byte (CB.1) before.
